APPLICATION OF DATAMINING FOR DIRECT MARKETING
Given all the statistics and challenges can the good old CRM data be made more effective. Can a sales organization improve itâ€™s market performance by analyzing customer data and come up with an efficient direct marketing campaign by improving customer experience during a sales call? The objective is to come up with an approach to predict the success of telemarketing calls for selling bank long-term deposits using machine learning classification techniques. The main task is to derive a machine learning model that can explain success of a contact, i.e. if the client subscribes the deposit. Such a model can increase campaign efficiency by identifying the main characteristics that affect success, helping in a better management of the available resources (e.g. human effort, phone calls, time) and selection of a high quality and affordable set of potential buying customers.CRM data of direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) from the banking institution is provided. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (target variable y). This case study is adapted from a research paper where the researchers Sergio Moro and Raul Laurceano have used a very similar dataset as the one provided to study the effectiveness of of Bank Telemarketing . As per the paper their model was able to achieve an AUC score of 0.8 and a ALIFT of 0.7. The objective of this exercise will be to come close to the effort.
